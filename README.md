# Stroke-Width-Transform
An implementation of the [Stroke-Width-Transform (SWT)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1509.pdf)  algorithm in Python, for detecting characters in natural images. Uses Image Processing techniques (edge detection, transforms) to detect areas of consistent stroke-width, and filters non-text areas based on learned heuristics.
